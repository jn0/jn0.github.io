## Some lyrics

The RPi arrives as a DIY kit of the board and radiators which are to be glued to chips.
![Delivered][i1]
The chips must be degreased first.

Due to modern local regulations it's impossible for a private person to buy some
pure alcohol here even for medical (w/o written prescription) or technical (I mean,
not for nutrition at all) purposes. Hence, there are workarounds. One can buy (~$12
for 0.2l) a [MAF Senor Cleaner][r2] spray instead, which is, in turn, almost pure
([0.76][r3] vs 0.786 g/cm³ @20°C, smells right) [isopropyl alcohol][r4] AKA isopropanol.
![Isopropanol][i3]

![Assembled][i2]
